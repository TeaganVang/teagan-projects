                    Anna May Wong, born in 1905 in Los Angeles,<br> 
                    California, was a pioneering Chinese-American<br>
                    actor who broke barriers in Hollywood when<br>
                    opportunities for Asian performers were scarce.<br>
                    Wong fought the ever-present obstacle of 
                    institutional racism in the film industry to 
                    forge a remarkable career that spanned 40  years. 
                    She contended with limited lead roles, 
                    stereotypical casting and vast pay inequities 
                    between her and her white counterparts.
